### About Me
---
I am Mustapha Unubi Momoh. I have worked mostly in applied machine learning. My recent experience includes information retrieval, specifically personalized search, recommender systems, and experimentation. I have also worked as a GenAI scientist, consulting for companies to build proof of concept (POC) applications utilizing diffusion models, large language models (LLMs), RAG techniques, vector databases, and graph databases. I also have experience in computer vision and took graduate-level computer vision courses while at the University of Waterloo.

My graduate studies research was at the intersection of causal inference and human computer interaction as well as virtual reality (VR). Part of the research was aimed at understanding telehealth preferences by measuring the relationship between socio-demographic variables like technology affinity and comfort levels in VR telehealth. By iteratively estimating a posterior (beta) distribution of the affinity for technology interaction (ATI) and the reported comfort levels in telehealth, the average treatment effect (ATE) was estimated via regression discontinuity design (RDD). The analysis adopted a Bayesian Inference framework. Additionally, ANOVA, factor analysis, and thematic analysis were conducted.
