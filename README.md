## Hi there.

### About Me
I am Mustapha Unubi Momoh. I have worked mostly in applied machine learning. My recent experience includes information retrieval specifically personalized search and recommender systems. I have also worked as a GenAI scientist, where I have consulted for companies to build proof of concept (POC) applications, utilizing diffusion models, RAG techniques, vector databases, and graph databases. I also have experience in computer vision and took graduate level computer vision courses while at the University of Waterloo.

My graduate studies research was at the intersection of causal inference and human computer interaction as well as virtual reality (VR). Specifically, the research was aimed at understanding telehealth preferences by measuring the relationship between technology affinity and comfort levels in VR telehealth. By estimating a posterior (beta) distribution of the affinity for technology interaction (ATI) and the reported comfort levels in telehealth, the average treatment effect (ATE) estimated via regression discontinuity design (RDD). A Bayesian inference approach was adopted for this analysis. Other techniques explored include factor analysis and thematic analysis.
