## Hi there.

### About Me
I am Mustapha. I work mostly in applied machine learning. My recent experience includes information retrieval specifically personalized search and recommender systems. I have also worked as a GenAI scientist, where I have consulted for companies to build Proof of concept (POC) applications, utilizing diffusion models, RAG techniques, vector databases, and graph databases (like Amazon Neptune). I also have experinece in computer vision and took graduate level computer vision courses while at the UNiversity of Waterloo.

My graduate studies research was at the intersection of causal inference and human computer interaction. Specifically, the research was aimed at understanding telehealth preferences by learning a posterior (beta) distribution of the affinity for technology interaction (ATI) and reported comfort in receiving diagnoses via telehealth, followed by computing the average treatment effect (ATE) via a regression discontinuity design (RDD) approach. Other techniques including factor analysis and thematic analysis were also explored. Here is a link to the published thesis: [Remote Medical Diagnosis in Virtual Reality: A mixed-methods Approach to Undertsanding the PErceptions of Patients and Physicians](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/ed73fad6-81d0-447d-b3ac-153c3e103fba).
