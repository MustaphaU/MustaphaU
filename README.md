### About Me
---
I am Mustapha Unubi Momoh. I have worked mostly in applied machine learning. My recent experience includes information retrieval, specifically personalized search, recommender systems, and experimentation. I have also worked as a GenAI scientist, consulting for companies to build proof of concept (POC) applications utilizing diffusion models, large language models (LLMs), RAG techniques, vector databases, and graph databases. I also have experience in computer vision and took graduate-level computer vision courses while at the University of Waterloo.

My graduate research combined causal inference, humanâ€“computer interaction, and virtual reality (VR). I studied telehealth adoption by modeling the impact of socio-demographic variables such as technology affinity on comfort with diagnosis in VR-based telehealth. This involved Bayesian beta regression and regression discontinuity design (RDD) for estimating treatment effects.
